# Landing Page - Portfolio

This project is a simple example of a portfolio landing page with **HTML** and **CSS** only.

    Purpose:  
A minimal starting point to progressively showcase my skills before adding more complex repositories.

    Features:  
- Clean HTML structure  
- CSS layout using Flexbox  
- No frameworks, no JavaScript  

This project is not my real portfolio !
